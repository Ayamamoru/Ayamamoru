## HI THERE!!!

i'm mo (or selina if you know me in person lol) :)

Uhm i'm a highschool coding-newbie (and Hackclubber!!) with an interest in making games (ren'py my beloved) and I'm currently learning how to use unity!
I pretty much suck at coding but somehow manage to make semi-working projects 50% of the time ðŸ˜­

I really love going to hackathons cause it's the only time I will ever be motivated/able to force myself to code at all. SO far I've been to Scrapyard (my first one!!), Lockdown ðŸ¥‡, JPEG and Daydream though I'm currently some 25 hours into the Athena Award...
I was also initially gonna do Neighborhood or Shipwrecked but sadly I'm too immature to travel on my own :((  

## my goals!!
- Uhm GO TO NYC WITH ATHENA RAHHH
- Get cracked enough to join my school robotics club...
- GET RICH AND STOP BEING UNEMPLOYED (mostly the latter)
- convince my parents that doing art won't make me fail school...
- LEAVE. THE. COUNTRY. AT LEAST ONE TIME (through coding :))
- Get my CC cert!
- diet coke

## some stats

btw my pronouns are she/they but feel free to use any you want (because honestly don't mind any at all whatsoever)
And uh here's my lil hackatime badge - "other" is just ren'py script lol
